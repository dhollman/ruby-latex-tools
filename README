=latex-tools
Tools for generating Latex code fragments

The latex-tools gem is a collection of classes that facilitate the writing of various elements of Latex code.  It is not designed for authoring entire Latex files, merely their component parts.  Right now, it only consists of one such 'tool', LatexTable, which provides an easy and convenient way of outputting Latex code for tables from data in a ruby script.

==Installation
Install the gem just like any other gem:
  gem install latex-tools


==Documentation Status
The classes (right now only LatexTable) should be documented well enough to get started, but individual class methods
are mostly undocumented.  This documentation will (hopefully) be added in the future.
